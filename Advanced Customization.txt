🎨 Testing Advanced Settings
1. Animation Speed ⚡
What it does: Controls how fast UI transitions happen (buttons, menus, modals, etc.)

How to test:

Set to "Fast (150ms)"

Click Save
Go to Chat page
Open/close the sidebar → Should animate quickly
Hover over buttons → Quick color transitions
Set to "Very Slow (700ms)"

Click Save
Refresh page
Open/close sidebar → Noticeably slow animation
Hover over buttons → Slow fade effect
Expected behavior:

Faster = snappier UI
Slower = smoother, more visible transitions
2. Enable Animations ✨
What it does: Turns all animations on/off globally

How to test:

Uncheck "Enable Animations"

Click Save
Reload page
Open sidebar → Should appear instantly (no slide animation)
Hover buttons → No transition effects
Modals open instantly
Check "Enable Animations"

Click Save
Reload page
Everything should animate smoothly
Expected behavior:

Disabled = Instant changes (better for accessibility/performance)
Enabled = Smooth transitions
3. Dark Mode Support 🌙
What it does: Enables automatic dark color variants

How to test:

Check "Enable Dark Mode Support"

Click Save
Change your system to dark mode:
Windows: Settings → Personalization → Colors → Dark
Mac: System Preferences → General → Appearance → Dark
Reload the app
Colors should automatically adjust to dark variants
Uncheck it

Click Save
System dark mode won't affect the app
Expected behavior:

Enabled + System Dark Mode = Dark color scheme
Disabled = Always uses your set colors
Note: Currently this might not work fully since dark mode implementation requires the CustomizationContext to apply dark variants. If it doesn't work, that's expected - it's marked as "Beta".

4. Custom CSS 🎨
What it does: Lets you add custom styling to override anything

How to test:

Add this CSS:

CSS

/* Make all buttons glow */
button {
  box-shadow: 0 0 20px rgba(59, 130, 246, 0.5) !important;
  transition: all 0.3s !important;
}

button:hover {
  transform: scale(1.05) !important;
  box-shadow: 0 0 30px rgba(59, 130, 246, 0.8) !important;
}
Click Save

Reload page

Hover over any button → Should glow and grow slightly

More test examples:

CSS

/* Change sidebar background to gradient */
aside {
  background: linear-gradient(180deg, #667eea 0%, #764ba2 100%) !important;
}

/* Make cards more rounded */
.card {
  border-radius: 24px !important;
}

/* Custom font for headings */
h1, h2, h3 {
  font-family: 'Georgia', serif !important;
  color: #8b5cf6 !important;
}
Expected behavior:

Any valid CSS should override default styles
Bad CSS is ignored
Use !important to force overrides
