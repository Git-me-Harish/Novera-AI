YOU'RE READY TO USE THE APPLICATION!
Option 1: Use What's Already Running (RECOMMENDED)
Since everything is already running from your docker-compose up, you can immediately use the application:

Open your browser: Go to http://localhost:5173
You should see the login page
Login with:
Email: admin@mentanova.com
Password: Admin@123
Start testing!
No need to run docker-compose again - it's already running!

CURRENT STATUS
Your services are running:

✅ Frontend: http://localhost:5173 (Open this in browser)
✅ Backend: http://localhost:8000 (API running)
✅ PostgreSQL: Running with admin user created
✅ Redis: Running
WHAT TO DO NOW
Step 1: Test Login
Open: http://localhost:5173
Login:
Email: admin@mentanova.com
Password: Admin@123
You should be redirected to the chat page
Step 2: Verify Admin Access
After login, check if you can see:

✅ Sidebar has "Admin" section
✅ Purple "Admin" badge near your username
✅ Can access "Dashboard" and "User Management"
Step 3: Test Admin Features
Go to Admin Dashboard: Click "Dashboard" under Admin section

Should show system stats
Go to User Management: Click "User Management"

Should show the admin user in the table
Click "Create User" to test creating a new user
Test Chat: Click "Chat" in sidebar

Try sending a test message
Test Documents: Click "Documents"

Try uploading a test document

DOCKER DESKTOP vs TERMINAL
You Can Use Either:
Option A: Keep Terminal Running (Recommended for development)

Advantage: See live logs
Can see errors immediately
Press Ctrl+C to stop when done
Option B: Use Docker Desktop

Go to Docker Desktop → Containers
You'll see mentanova_backend, mentanova_frontend, etc.
Can stop/start from there
Can view logs by clicking on containers
IF YOU WANT TO STOP AND START AGAIN
To Stop (in terminal where it's running):
Bash

# Press Ctrl+C
# Wait for graceful shutdown
To Start Again Later:
Bash

# In your project directory
docker-compose up

# OR in background (detached mode)
docker-compose up -d
To View Logs When Running in Background:
Bash

docker-compose logs -f
TESTING CHECKLIST
Try these in order:

✅ Login as admin → Should work
✅ See admin dashboard → Should show stats
✅ Create a test user →
Go to User Management
Click "Create User"
Fill: email=test@test.com, username=testuser, password=Test@123, role=user
Click "Create"
✅ Logout and login as test user → Should have limited access (no admin section)
✅ Upload a document → Test document upload feature
✅ Test chat → Send a message in chat
QUICK VERIFICATION
Open a new terminal and run:

PowerShell

# Check if backend is responding
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/health

# Check if admin user exists
docker-compose exec postgres psql -U mentanova_user -d mentanova_db -c "SELECT email, role FROM users;"
You should see:

text

       email         | role
